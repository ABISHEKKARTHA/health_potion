We're going to be making a health potion for a video game.


We imagine that this character has walked over a health potion and the health potion magically increases their health by a random amount.

I guess in this case quite a lot but the game also has three difficulty settings easy medium and hard depending on what difficulty is selected.

The amount of health that the person gets from the potion will change and this will be less on higher difficulties.
